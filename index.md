Hi! My name is Nhat-Tien Nguyen. I am junior technology management major at Texas A&M Univserity. I am from New Orleans, Louisiana but moved to Houston in 2005 after hurricane Katrina. Some of my hobbies include listening to music, watching football, and building custom keyboards. Building custom keyboards is one of my newest hobby's that I have dived in too recently because the customizability and freedom to design your own tool that you use everyday has excited me. 

Howdy! My name is Lukas Boeck!
I am a junior Technology Management major as well as a Human Resource Development major.
I am from Leander, Texas where I graduated from Leander High School.
